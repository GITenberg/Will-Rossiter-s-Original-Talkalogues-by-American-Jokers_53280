Well, well! here we are again! I
just did manage to get here
on time, too. I never thought
I’d be able to do it in the
world. My wife and I were out
riding in our automobile, and we got into a
heated argument as to which of us was the
better chauffeur. During the excitement of
the argument we both neglected to hold the
lines of the automobile, and it shied at a
piece of paper and ran away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instinct told us both to make a grab, I for
the lever and she for my hair. Just then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>automobile struck the curb-stone, and my
wife and I had a “falling out.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i03.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>My wife and I had a “falling out.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There I was, several miles from the theater,
with a broken-down automobile and an
angry wife that wouldn’t speak to me.
Wasn’t that suffering for you? I felt sure
that I could make it to the theater all right,
but I didn’t know whether I’d have time to
“make up” or not.</p>

<p class='c005'>This trying to please a woman is a tough
game. I tell you, ladies, the trouble is the
men don’t know just how to take their
wives. Now I took mine in an automobile,
and it turned out a frost. Maybe if I had
taken her in a wheelbarrow she’d have
thought it delightful—still, I doubt it.</p>

<p class='c005'>But I wasn’t married always; I was an
American citizen once myself. I say American
citizen once, because an American citizen
prides himself that he is under no tyrannical
ruler, enjoys liberty and the fact that
he can do as he pleases. Therefore, a married
man can’t be an American citizen.</p>

<p class='c005'>The reason I married was that I was out
of work. I answered an advertisement for
a situation, and the proprietor asked me “if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>I was married.” I told him no, that I was
single. Then he said: “Well, I’d give you
the position at once, only I must have a
married man.” I said: “Keep the place open
for about an hour, and I’ll fix that all right—it’s
easier to get married than it is to get
a job.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There’s no trouble in getting married at
all; the trouble starts after you are married—when
you have to get up in the middle of
the night and walk the floor with Reginald
singing coon songs; that is, Reginald does
not sing coon songs—you’ve got to sing
to Reggy; and you can’t sing a lullaby, or
you’d go to sleep yourself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Why, I had an awfully hard time getting
used to it; the kid used to cry so much that
it wouldn’t even stop for meals. The neighbors
all said: “O, my! why don’t you feed
that baby on Mellin’s food? It would make
a different child of him.” I didn’t say a
word to anyone, but went out and bought
eight watermelons and five cantaloupes and
then I fed him till I thought he’d bust. Well,
after the doctors brought him to, he was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>different child; they asked me why I didn’t
feed him on cucumbers and sliced tripe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course, after that experience I knew
better. So I got a box of the true article at
the druggist’s, and took the baby on my knee
to feed him. The directions said: “Before
feeding the baby, shake well.” Well, that
was pie for me, because I had it in for him,
anyway. I nearly shook the life out of him;
then I fed him.</p>

<p>“Before feeding the baby, shake well.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I was overly anxious to follow the directions
strictly to the letter, so I read the whole
thing through two or three times to make
sure. Down near the bottom it read:
“N. B.—After child is fed—set in a cool
place—” I put him in the ice-box.</p>

I went home the other evening
and my wife said: “Ed, you
know that this is the night
that we are to go to the swell
reception given by the Richmonds.”
I said: “Yes, dear, I remember.”
I hadn’t given it a thought, but I wasn’t
going to tell her that. Then she came over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and put her arms around me and started to
cry. I asked what the trouble was, and she
said: “Well, you know, dear, I only
intended getting just a light dinner, because,
you know, we’ll get plenty to eat at the
reception.” Then I lied again and said: “Yes,
I know.” “Well,” she went, on, “the cook
has allowed what little we were going to
have to burn, and now there isn’t a thing in
the house fit to eat. But don’t scold,” she
said, “for she is so young and inexperienced,
and, besides, she’s so sweet; won’t a kiss
do instead?” I was pretty hungry, but I
said: “All right; send her in.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i07.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>Put her arms around me and started to cry</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For a long time I didn’t think we’d go to
the reception—but, finally I squared matters
and told her to run on and get dressed. I
read the evening paper until she started putting
on her hat,—and then I started to get
ready. After I was dressed and waiting
about five minutes she said she was ready.
So we started for the reception, she on her
dignity and I on an empty stomach. And I
might as well say right here, I took my
empty stomach back home with me again,
for all I saw there to eat was some opera-glass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>sandwiches—that is, you could look
through them.</p>

<p class='c005'>With these they passed around lemonade,
and after that was gobbled up by the hungry
mob they flashed a box or two of bon-bons.
Think of it—bon-bons on an empty stomach!
If it wasn’t for fear of my wife being jealous
I’d have gone to the kitchen and made a play
for the cook.</p>

<p class='c005'>I never attended anything that I got so
disgusted with in all my life. Did you ever
have to go to one, fellows, with your wife?
The women all sit around in bunches, and
each bunch runs down the others. Mrs.
Hypocrite will look up rather suddenly to see
if she can discover anybody talking about
her, and she notices that Mrs. Stabyouinthe
Back is gazing fixedly at her; then, each seeing
that they are caught, smile sweetly, bow
to each other and go back to knocking.</p>

<p class='c005'>How can they do it, girls? How can they
do it? Each woman there knew, deep down
in her heart, that every woman three feet
away was talking about her! If it wasn’t
about her hat being one of last season’s
styles it was about the way her dress was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>made; and if both of these happened to be
above criticism then they would say: “O,
pshaw! what good is all that finery to her?
It doesn’t become her! It would be just
the same if she had a Worth gown on, and
the hat—well, she could put on picture-hats
from all the picture-books published and it
wouldn’t make her look dressed! Why, she
can look well with nothing on!”</p>

<p class='c005'>As though that woman would go to a reception
with nothing on!</p>

<p class='c005'>But the part that takes my time is that
after all their knocking they stand in the hall
when it’s time to go home, and, with the
door open until everybody in the house is
chilled to death, they have three or four
rounds of kisses, tell what a delightful time
they have had and invite each other to come
and see them!</p>

<p class='c005'>Henceforth I scratch receptions off my list.
Nothing but a stag goes with me any more.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was one poor fellow there that I
took quite a fancy to—he was holding up the
wall opposite to me. After a bit I went over
and spoke to him. “How are you getting
on?” I asked. “O, I’m holding up all right,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>he said—I didn’t know whether he meant the
wall or his spirits.</p>

<p class='c005'>We talked for a while, and then he gaped
and said: “Excuse me”; and I gaped and said:
“Excuse me.” Then after a bit I gaped and
said: “Pardon me”; and he gaped immediately
after me and said: “Pardon me,” and
we went on talking. Finally he said: “Don’t
you think it’s a long gap between gaps?” I
said: “So it is.” Then, feeling one coming
on, I said: “Have a gap on me.” He said:
“Not on your life! The last one was on you;
have this one on me”—and I did.</p>

<p class='c005'>I said: “It’s awfully slow here, isn’t it?”
“I should say it is,” he replied. I said: “Let’s
go home.” “I am home,” he said; “my wife
is giving this affair.”</p>

My mother-in-law is a lovely woman—at
least, that’s what my
wife tells me, anyway; so it
must be so. The old dame thinks
a great deal of me, too—in
fact, she’s always thinking of me, and she’s
not the little girl that’s afraid to tell me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>what she’s thinking, either. My! but my
left ear is burning!</p>

<p class='c005'>We came near losing her the other day—unintentionally
on our part, too, because
you couldn’t lose her if you tried.</p>

<p class='c005'>It happened in this way: We have a large,
old-fashioned clock hanging in the hall. It’s
a massive affair and weighs quite a bit. Well,
we were all surprised to hear a terrible crash,
which was caused by the clock falling from
its place on the wall and breaking in a thousand
pieces.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now my mother-in-law figures in the story
in this way: She had been standing right underneath
that clock only two minutes before
it fell—and had walked away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course, I was awfully sorry—to lose
the clock, as it had been in our family for
generations back, and in all those years it
had kept good time up until the time it fell—and
then it was ONLY TWO MINUTES
SLOW.</p>

Of all the narrow escapes from
death I ever witnessed I think
the one that I saw to-day was
nothing short of a miracle. I
was walking along Broadway
[substitute local street] when my attention
was attracted to a man standing on a scaffold
painting an advertising sign on the fourth
story of a building. It made me feel dizzy
to look up at him. He worked away, seemingly
unconscious of his dangerous position.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly I noticed him stagger; he made a
grab for one of the ropes to protect himself,
but missed it. I closed my eyes in horror
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>as I saw him fall—the blood seemed to
freeze in my very veins—I felt faint.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i12.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>I closed my eyes in horror</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I could stand the suspense no longer. I
opened my eyes, but all seemed blurred
before them. “Is he dead?” I asked of a
man standing by my side. “No; he’s all
right,” the man answered. “But he fell,
didn’t he?” I cried. “O, yes, he fell all
right,” he said; “but he landed on a bunch
of rubber-necks and bounced back on the
scaffold again.”</p>

Wishing to make the jump from
New York to Chicago a few
weeks ago, I called on a friend
of mine who stands pretty well
with one of the officials of a
certain railroad. I asked my friend if he
thought he could get me a rate over that
line, and he promised to see what he could
do for me.</p>

<p class='c005'>He said: “I’ll go right down, and if I can
possibly get you a rate I’ll send word up to
your hotel.” I said: “All right, old man;
I’ll appreciate it very much.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>After waiting around the hotel for about
an hour I recollected that I had a little business
to transact down town, and I thought
I’d have time to attend to it and get back to
my hotel before the message arrived concerning
the rate. So I bought a newspaper and
jumped on a down-town car.</p>

<p class='c005'>I had scarcely rode over four or five blocks
when the conductor came by and shook me
roughly by the arm and said, in a rough,
surly manner: “Hey, you! Did you expectorate?
[Expect a rate.] Now don’t sit there
and tell me that you didn’t,” he added, “for
I know you did.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i14.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>“Hey, you! did you expectorate?”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I was on my feet in an instant. “Why,
you little insignificant, illiterate collector of
plugged coins and dispenser of pennies!” I
cried. “What do you mean by insulting me
before this car full of people? Yes,” I said,
“I did expect a rate, but that’s my affair.
It’s none of your confounded business, nor
anyone else’s, if I expect a pass! What I
expect and what I don’t expect concern me
alone!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, is that so?” he sneered. “You’re
going to bluff me—that’s what you expect.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Now here’s what you don’t expect”—and
he called a policeman and had me arrested for
spitting on the floor of the car.</p>

Did you ever have the toothache?
My! but isn’t it a great thing
to make you forget all your
other troubles? I had the toothache
the other night, and it
nearly had me wild. I wouldn’t have minded
being awakened by the tooth so much, but
it was the nerve of the thing that struck me—and
it struck me properly.</p>

<p class='c005'>I jumped up, dressed myself and dashed
over to the dentist’s. I said: “Doc, you
argue with it, will you—you’ve got more
of a pull than I have.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Then after he had it out he showed it to
me, and I was surprised to think that such a
tiny thing could make a person act so foolishly.</p>

<p class='c005'>But I wasn’t the only one in misery, for
there was a lady that came in shortly after I,
and her jaw was swollen out like that.
[Measure.] The doctor looked in her mouth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and said: “My dear madam, you have evidently
made a mistake—this is a dental office,
not a quarry. You’ll have to take that to
some place where they blast rock.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I went into a cigar-store the other day, and
walking up to the counter I said to the proprietor:
“Let me have a Childs cigar.”
“Pardon me, sir,” he said; “but what did
you say you wanted?” “A Childs cigar, if
you please,” I replied. “A child’s cigar? I
am very sorry,” he said; “but we are not
allowed to sell a child a cigar—but if a cinnamon
cigarette will do you any good I can
sell you one of those.”</p>

I had a friend once that suffered
terribly from a half-dozen different
complaints. He woke
up in the middle of the night
once, and he didn’t know what
ached him the most—the cold that had settled
on his chest, his liver that was out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>order, or the corn that he had on his little
toe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Anyway he got up, dressed himself and
woke the druggist up to fix him some medicine
that would give him some relief. The
druggist fixed him up a powerful liniment,
some pills and a corn-plaster, saying: “Rub
your chest with the liniment for your cold,
swallow the pills for your liver and use the
corn-plaster for your toe.”</p>

<p class='c005'>My friend kept repeating this to himself
all the way back home, but when he got
there he was all puzzled up. He stuck the
corn-plaster on his chest, swallowed the liniment
and tied the pills on his corn.</p>

<p class='c005'>After that, he never suffered any more
pain—he died without a struggle.</p>

Isn’t it strange the funny things
a man will run into? Now I
ran into a well-known comedian
this morning. I got an
awful bump, too—it cost me
a V. Have you ever noticed that an actor
whom nature has best fitted for comedy invariably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>wants to break into the legit., and
vice versa?</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, for instance, the man that I met this
morning is doing comedy, while every one
that knows him will tell you that he is at
his best in “touching” scenes. He can get
my testimonial any old time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Do you know a woman can’t stand flattery?
It’s a fact. Now I went home the
other evening, and, seeing my wife so earnestly
engaged with the housework I could
not refrain from commenting on it. I said:
“Why, my dear, you’re as busy as a bee”—and
the next day she got all jollied up and
broke out with the hives.</p>

giving women the same right

are against giving woman the right to vote,

In a small town in New England,
where the laws against prize-fighting
are very strict, an
ambitious youth by the name
of Green was caught training
for a fight. He was arrested and brought
before the Judge, who said: “Mr. Green,
you are charged with violating the law by
training for a prize-fight; have you anything
to say in your defense?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, your honor,” said Green, “is it
against the law for a young lady to put on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>a corset?” “No,” replied the Judge, “it is
not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, your honor,” said Green, “I ask to
be discharged, as there is no difference

Ladies and gentlemen, and those
that are sitting in the boxes,
and you, too, orchestra, you’ll
pardon me if I hesitate for a moment,
but I’ve just returned
from a very long walk. All the way from
Squashopolis, b’gosh! I think that was the
name of the town where our show closed.
We say “Closed,” you see. You know when
a saloon-keeper or a bank, or a chop-suey
restaurant, or an iceman, gives up business,
we say that the owner liquidated, or busted
up, or went to the devil, or it was a frost;
but a theatrical troupe always “closes.” It
sounds better, you know; just as if the manager
got tired taking in money and was hiding
some place so that no one could throw
any twenty-dollar gold-pieces at him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>But Squashopolis is a great town! Ever
heard of Squashopolis? No? Why, it’s right
between Pumpkinhollow and Spinachville.
Squashopolis is the largest town on the map.
You see it was this way: The mayor and the
fire-department and the postmaster—that is,
the fellow that ran the saloon—bought a
map of Indiana to find out where they were
at, and finding that the man who wrote the
map had made a mistake and overlooked the
flourishing town of Squashopolis, the mayor
and the fire-department, etc., of the aforesaid
town betook themselves to the pen and
ink and placed Squashopolis upon the map in
a manner calculated to give their beloved
town its due importance and dignity; and
that is how Squashopolis became the largest
town on the map. The census of the village—I
took it myself—revealed the fact that
its population consists of one saloon and
three dogs. You see the town has gone to
the dogs. I asked the man at the railroad
station where I could find the mayor. He
said: “Why, the mayor’s left and gone to
the Klondike.” “How’d that happen?” He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>said: “Why, money makes the mayor go.”
Well, I’ll sing you a sing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, I see that I’ve come out of that
alive; now I’ll hand you some more. Now,
in all my adventures on land or sea, and I’ve
often been at sea as to where I was going to
land (you never can tell in this business), in
all my travels the saddest event in my career
occurred the other day. I was invited
to a swell dinner party—you know, a handful
of lettuce and a cup of coffee; they’re something
fierce; you all know how they are—maybe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, as soon as I got through my turn I
left the theater prepared for a long walk, as
it was some distance from—pay-day. I
stepped into the alley—you know they always
dump us into the alley when they get
through with us (they dump everything into
the alley—actors, ashes, everything), then
you have to sneak your way between the
piles. Why, it, was only last night that I
fell in a heap.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, right on the corner of the alley I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>noticed a man posting some bills. I said:
“See here! Don’t post any bills there.”
He says: “Why not?” I said: “Don’t you
see that sign: ‘Post no bills under penalty’?”
“Well, you big lobster,” said he, “don’t
you see I’m posting them over penalty?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now that man was in the wrong business.
I said to him: “What are you posting those
bills for?” He says: “Why, don’t you see?
Them are pictures of Richard Mansfield. He
said if I’d stick these pictures up for him he’d
buy the drinks.” I said: “O, I see; you’re
sticking him for the drinks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I just reached the sidewalk when I was approached
by a tramp; no, not an actor, but
a decent, hard-working tramp. Yes, a hard-working
tramp; I know he worked me hard
enough. He was one of those fellows who
has a child and sixteen wives to support. He
said: “Friend, can you help a poor old slob
who has got money in the bank but don’t
know how to make out a check?” You
know I’m generous; I’ve never yet refused
any beggar who came to me and asked—for
a match. With tears in his voice he said:
“Say, mister, save me from a watery grave.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“How’s that?” I asked. “Young fellow,”
he says, “if you don’t give me a quarter I’ll
have to work in a soap factory or jump in
the lake.” Well, I couldn’t help parting with
a week’s salary, so I gave him a quarter.
You know, somehow, he touched me. The
man was overjoyed. “Friend,” he says,
“you’ve saved my life. I don’t know how
to thank you. I feel as though I never could
repay you.” He never did.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i28.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>I was approached by a tramp.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Talk about beggars! That night I met
them all. If there was any I missed they were
on a vacation. They all seemed to take to
me. They all seemed to keep in touch with
me, as it were. One man had nerve enough
to ask me for 19 cents to buy a shirtwaist.
I gave him the 19 and told him not to waste
it. Talk about begging! I asked one man
what he did for a living and he begged the
question. I asked: “Why don’t you go to
work?” He says: “I can’t; I’m a cripple.”
I says: “That’s a lame excuse.” “Well,” he
says, “you see I’m tongue-tied and I can’t
do a lick of work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a young worried woman—I mean
married woman—stopped and said: “Excuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>me, sir, but I’m in such trouble. My husband
gave me sixty cents to go down to the
Boston Store and buy some radishes and a
new folding-bed, and I forgot myself and
thought that I was single and spent the
money for a bunch of Allegretti’s; and now
I haven’t any money to buy the radishes, and
I don’t know how in the world to get home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I always did pity a woman in distress so I
showed her the way. Then a man came up
to me and said—well, before he could say
anything I asked him: “Well, what is it?
Radishes or a folding-bed?” He says: “I
don’t understand you. I wanted information
as to where [local street] is.” “O,” I said,
“you want information? I thought you
wanted a nickel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The doctors say that begging is a disease,
and I notice everybody has a “touch” of it.
Why, I believe there are more beggars in this
town than there are prohibitionists in Milwaukee.
Why, all the boxers in China are a
Sweet Caporal guard along side the soldiers
of misfortune I met that night. I made a
detour around the courthouse to avoid their
left flank, but I was confronted by the enemy’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>center, which advanced toward me and
occupied a strong position on [local street.]</p>

<p class='c005'>They were commanded by a blind man with
a picture of his finish on a sixteen-inch hand-organ.
With this he was doing great execution—to
the music. Among the wounded
were the “Wild Irish Rose,” “She Is a Sensible
Girl,” “My Rainbow Coon,” “Whistling
Rufus” and a “Bird in a Gilded Cage.” “The
Georgia Camp-Meeting” was also badly broken
up.</p>

<p class='c005'>My retreat being cut off by their right
flank, which moved around to cop me at
[local store] kopje, I decided to cut my way
through the center and encounter the enemy
en masse, en massay, en massee—well, in
great big juicy bunches.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the enemy approached me; as [local
writer] would say, he was brimful of the
bibulous effervescence of concentrated outpourings
of the intellectual excrescences resulting
from the imbibition of infinitesimal—well,
he was drunk. He started a spirited
argument with me. I scented trouble, and
observing trouble—I mean a copper—I gave
him a cent. He gave me several scents and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>almost lost my senses. He tried to thank
me but I told him not to breathe a word of
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a deah little child came up to mah and
spoke to mah. She said she was a long way
from home. Her aunt had given her three
cents to chase herself to the parental roof—to
ride home on—and she lost the money.
Seeing she was but a little child (under 12
years), I thought it was only half fare, so I
put her on the car.</p>

<p class='c005'>At this point the organ-grinder with a
monkey began a disturbance on the corner.
One man declared he ought to be “pinched.”
I said: “Certainly not.” He asked: “Why
not?” I said: “He is a human being and has
a perfect right to use his own organ.” He
says: “Yes, as long as he doesn’t monkey
with anybody else’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I will now beg leave to change the subject,
and tell you about the dinner party I mentioned
seven minutes ago. Well, no sooner
had I arrived at my destination than I was
greeted by the hostess, who said: “Why,
how do you do? Won’t you recite something?”
You know they think an actor is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>just like a slot-machine. You throw in a
meal and out comes a stunt. Well, I didn’t
like the meal very well, so I sung them a
song.</p>

I have just returned from the Pacific
slip—slop—slope, I meant
to say. Excuse the slop—I
mean the slip of the tongue. I
say “returned,” but I didn’t
say in what way. That’s a long walk—I
mean talk—I should say story. That slip—slop—slope
has got me sloppy—slippy—twisted,
I mean.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, while on the slip—slop—slippery
slope, I slopped—slipped in love. I fell in
love from slipping on the sloppy slope. I
came pretty near getting a life sentence—married,
I mean; it’s the same thing. The girl
I loved was a brunette by birth. You know
some are brunettes by accident; this girl was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>born that way. I don’t like brunettes. I like
the blondes. This girl from the slope was a
slippery—slobbery—slobby—I mean nobby—girl
and was deeply infatuated with me.
She would do anybody, anything for me.
She declared she would die for me—and she
did. That’s how she’s a blonde now.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her father was a doctor—a “cure-all.” He
claimed he could cure anything. When he
found out I loved his daughter he tried to
cure my love for her. He gave me a prescription.
His specialty was rejections—injections,
I mean. So he injected a load of
buckshot into my frame. He said I needed
something to increase my weight, so he
filled me with lead.</p>

<p class='c005'>The prescription was a good one, though.
If they hadn’t called in another doctor to
pick out the shot, my love would have certainly
proved fatal. They took me to a
horse-pistol—I mean a hospital. While I
was filled with lead the boys used to come in
and borrow me to go fishing with. They
used me for a stinker—I mean a sinker. One
day I asked the nurse how much longer I was
going to be laid up and used for a sinker and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>she said I’d be well enough to leave just as
soon as the fish quit biting. They couldn’t
find all the shot that the prescription called
for, so I had to leave the hospital “half-shot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, I finally did a slide from the slope and
came east by way of the Northern Precipitate—Northern
Pacific, I should say.</p>

<p class='c005'>We started a game of poker on the train.
I lost thirty dollars. When the train was
twenty miles out I was thirty dollars out. I
didn’t have a cent left. The conductor
asked me for my fare and just then the train
stopped. One of the passengers called to the
conductor and said: “What’s the matter?
Anything broke?” The conductor said;
“Yes, one of the passengers.” Then the
conductor asked me if I could fix the “break.”
I couldn’t, so I got off.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the conductor began to kick about
having to stop the train, and I was the receiver
for his kicks. They came so fast I
couldn’t stop them all. I do hate to feel—hear
a man kick against little things. It
wasn’t fair—or rather it was fare—that is,
I didn’t have the fare. But anyhow it made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>me sore. I wouldn’t get back on his old
train.</p>

<p class='c005'>After I had collected my thoughts and the
other parts of my anatomy, I found I was
several parts of anatomy shy; so I went up
to the conductor and I asked him if he had
any old anatomy of mine hanging to him;
that is, if I had anything coming that I had
not got. He raised his foot—his large,
massive right foot. I looked at it. It was
too large for me; it wasn’t my size. I knew
as soon as I looked at it it wouldn’t fit me,
so I began to wend my way. I found it was
cheaper to wend my way than to pay my
way.</p>

<p class='c005'>When I got to the next station I went into
a balloon—I mean salome—so long—saloon;
I always did forget that word. Well,
on the wall was one of those strong—wrong
long-distance telephones—nickel-in-the-slit—slop—slap—slot
machine. I thought I’d
call up the doctor and tell him what I thought
of him. I didn’t think much of him—only
about five cents’ worth.</p>

<p class='c005'>So I slipped up to the slot and slipped a
nickel in the slot to get a connection with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the slope I had just slipped from. Just then
the keeper of the life-shaving—life-saving
station, the bar-slender—sender—tender,
asked me what I wanted; I said I thought I’d
take a gee whiz—a ginfizz. He said I had
another thunk coming, so I told him I would
take a glass of Schlitz before I heard from
the slope. So I slanted a glass of Schlitz in
the slot in my face and slowly sopped—sipped
the Schlitz. Just then the telephone-bell
rang; I went to the rang and rung the
ring.</p>

<p class='c005'>The doctor says: “Who are you?” I says:
“I’m the fellow that took your prescription.”
He says: “Well, what are you calling
me up for?” I says: “I ain’t calling
you up; I’m calling you down.” He says:
“I think you sloped from the slope with my
child, you slob, and if ever I see you again
I’ll puncture your——”</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then the barfender—bender—lender—tender
asked me to have another Schlitz,
so I dropped the fender—the sender to sip
the Schlitz. Just as I sized up the Schlitz to
seize it the bartender told me to settle for
the last Schlitz. I couldn’t settle, so the bartender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>settled me. He gave me a sassy slap
in the slats and spilled all the Schlitz that I
had sipped.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then I got desperate and commenced dropping
nickels in the Schlitz and Schlitzes in the
slots, then I got some more slaps in the slats;
the doctor was trying to call me and I was
calling the bartender—something I can’t repeat
here, and—well, I finally got out and
after a while, about thirty days after, I
reached home—my old home. My father
and mother said it was the home of my birth.
Well, if “my birth” owned that home he
never got any rent for it. The first person
I met was a girl. Of course I met three politicians;
but she was the first person. She
was a singular person; she was the first person
singular—singular because she wasn’t
married. But that wasn’t so singular, because
she was born with only one good eye.
In the other one she got in a crockery store—kind
of a bum pair of lamps.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then one day she had the misfortune to be
walking on a railroad track and she met a
train—that, is, the train met her. Of course,
there was no regular introduction; they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>just came together as people and trains will.
Well, the train met her and now she’s got a
cork—she’s got a corker. [Slap leg with
hand.] Well, as I say, I met the corker—I
mean the girl—and she told me she was engaged
to be led to the slaughter—I mean sled
to the halter—I mean led to the altar; going
to be murdered—married; and she invited
me to bring presents—I mean to be present
at the wedding.</p>

<p class='c005'>There wasn’t many people knew she had a
corker. The fellow that was going to board
her for life didn’t know she had a corker,
either. The day before the wedding the gloom—that
is, the groom—you know, the fellow
that was going to marry the corker—I mean
the girl—well, he was kind of a diffident fellow;
he asked me to go to the parsley—the
parsnips—the parson with him, and I went
with the victim.</p>

<p class='c005'>The parson charged him $5.00 to tie the
connubial nit—the connubial knot. The parson
said: “My dear sir; I will charge you
$5.00 to set you sailing on the sea of matrimony.”
My friend said: “Well, what’ll
you charge for a round-trip ticket?” You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>see he didn’t know about the corker, but he
was a corker. He says: “I’ll save you $4.00
to tie the conjugal knit-knot”—not knit
but knot. But the parson refused. He said:
“$5.00 or knot—nit.” The parson would
not take any less than $5.00 for the imposition—the
operation. He belonged to the
“union.” So my friend that was engaged
to the corker paid him the flea—the fee to
knit the knot—I mean tie the knot. Well,
the next day we all went to the church to
see the fight—the wedding.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young couple stood up in front of the
parson and the parson opened a jackpot—I
mean the Bible, looked all around the church
and said: “Is there anybody here to give the
bride away?” I jumped up and said: “Yes, I
can, but I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the queer—I mean the choir sang
queer—that is, the queer choir sang “Take
Me Just as I Am.” And the young fellow
did. Of course, he didn’t know anything
about the corker until——</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, an old woman, 78 or 48, who lived
in the town died one day. Of course, that
isn’t strange, because old women die every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>day. But this particular old lady—but she
couldn’t have been particular, either, or she
wouldn’t have died. But anyhow she died,
with a will, or against her will; that is, she
had a will or left a will when she died. In
the will she bequeathed to the corker—I
mean the girl who married the fellow that
didn’t know she had a corker—she bequeathed
to her an old arm-chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everybody gave the young couple the
horse-laugh, but the young fellow took the
old arm-chair home and put it in the house
along with the glass eye and the corker. A
few days after that they sat down to the
breakfast-table—the fellow, the glass eye,
the arm-chair and the corker—and while sitting
at breakfast, talking over their cocoa,
the husband said something over his cocoa,
and then the wife said something over her
cocoa, and they got into an argument over
their cocoa, and finally he picked up the old
arm-chair, over his cocoa, and passed it to
his wife, over her cocoa, and broke it all to
pieces—not the cocoa, but the old arm-chair.
The old arm-chair was smashed all to
pieces and out rolled fifteen million dollars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>in gold bull-con—bull-coin—gold bullion.
You see, this wise old lady knew that the
husband would break the old chair over his
wife’s cocoa when he found she had a——</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i30.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p>Out rolled fifteen million dollars in gold</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Well, the result was a divorce, and naturally
the fellow that married the remnant—the
girl—came to me, as I had been present
at the execution—at the wedding—and he
naturally looked upon me as a confidence
man—as a confidant—and he asked me my
advice.</p>

<p class='c005'>You see the corker’s brother, a big fellow
that weighed about two hundred and looked
it, had taken offense at the sister’s husband
talking about family secrets and was out
looking for trouble. So when the husband
came to me for advice I told him to challenge
the brother to a duel. He said he didn’t
know anything about a duel. So I told him
to go get a pair of gloves, go up to the brother
and slap him in the face with the gloves.</p>

<p class='c005'>The next day the young fellow got a pair
of gloves, went up to the big brother and
slapped him in the face with the gloves. Then
he came back to report to me. I says:
“Well, did you get the gloves?” He says:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Yes.” I says: “What did you do after
you got the gloves?” He says: “I did just
what you told me to do. I took the gloves
in my hand and went up to the big guy and
slapped him in the face with the gloves.” I
says: “Well, what did he do?” He says:
“He knocked me down and took the gloves
away from me.”</p>

You’ve heard about the deacon,
haven’t you? Deacon Jones?
No? Well, well! I thought you
had. The deacon went up to
our minister one Sunday afternoon and
told him he was looking for advice.
The reverend gentleman desired to know on
what particular subject he required advice.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve taken to playing golf,” explained the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>other, “and I—er—I find it difficult to restrain—er——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, I see what you mean,” said the minister—“bad
language.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly,” replied the pillar of the church.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, how would it be to put a stone in
your pocket every time you found yourself
using a wrong word, just as a reminder, you
know?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The very thing!” exclaimed the deacon;
“thank you so much!” and departed.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few days later the worthy cleric was
passing along the road which led to the links,
when he met an individual whose clothes
stuck out all over, with great, knobby lumps.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gracious me, Mr. Bagshawe!” he cried,
as the object approached nearer, “is that
really you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, it’s me,” grunted the voice of the
deacon.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, you don’t mean—surely all those
are not the result of my suggestion?” continued
the horrified parson, gazing at the
telltale bulges.</p>

<p class='c005'>“These!” snorted the other contemptuously;

When I was out West I saw two
miners playing cards in a place
called Toughnut Cafe. They
finally found their amusement
rather a dull one, for neither
could overreach the other. At last one of
the precious pair pushed his chair back, arose,
and said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m tired of this; let’s have a change—I’ll
jest bet yer a even thousand that I kin
take them keerds and cut the jack o’ hearts
the very fust time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll take yer,” replied the other, a very
quiet fellow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Stakes were deposited with an onlooker,
and a pack of cards was produced and laid on
the table between the gamblers. The layer of
the bet thereupon drew his bowie-knife and
neatly sliced the cards in two from top to
bottom.</p>

The agreement was that I were to cut the

didn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wal, no,” said the other, “I rayther think
not, for th’ jack were not there. Yer see,

to take the precaution of placing

Jap Johnson told me that! The
greatest man to jump into a
town and get acquainted with
folks I ever saw, Jap was. Give
Jap a night and a day in a
country place and everybody there would
call him by his first name, and he’d call
everybody the same way, even the girls. In
forty-eight hours he’d know every man,
woman, child, horse, dog and cat in the
town, and could tell who married who, who
got drunk once in a while, and who had fits
or rheumatics. Give him three days in a
town and he’d have every bit of the gossip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and old, musty scandals that ever went over
the back fences of that town. He was a
wonderful man, Jap was, and he could sell
goods like a house afire.</p>

<p class='c005'>The biggest thing he ever did, though, was
about four years ago. He had four hours to
spend in a little town out west. In that
time he sold two bales of goods, was invited
to dinner by the mayor, decided four bets,
was referee in a dog-fight, proposed marriage
and was accepted by the belle of the
place, borrowed ten dollars from her pa, beat
another man two games of billiards, and, it
happening to be election day, he capped the
whole by sailing in and having himself elected
town clerk by a majority of eleven votes.</p>

Did you see me this morning? My
cousin Silas was with me! He’s
a good fellow, Silas is! Deacon
of the church in Kerosenelampville!
Ever been there? If
you haven’t you’ve missed a lot—of trouble.
I took Silas up to our club one afternoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and when he saw Billy Smith and Chris
Lane playing chess he ventured to interrupt
the game.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Excuse me,” he said, “but the object of
both of you is to git them wooden things
from where they are over to where they
ain’t?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That partly expresses it,” replied Chris.</p>

<p class='c005'>“An’ you’ve got to be continually on the
lookout fer surprises an’ difficulties?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Constantly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And if you ain’t mighty careful you’re
going to lose some on ’em?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“An’ then there’s that other game I see
some of you dress up odd for, an’ play with
long sticks an’ a little ball.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You mean golf?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s what I mean. Is that game amusin’?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s interesting, and the exercise is beneficial.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I reckon it’s a mighty good joke.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To what do you refer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The way I’ve been havin’ fun without
knowing anything about it. If you young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>gentlemen want to reely enjoy yourselves,
you come over to my farm an’ git me to let
you drive pigs. You’ll git all the walkin’
you want, an’ the way you have to watch
for surprises, an’ slip about so’s not to lose
’em, would tickle you nearly to death.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i05.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>One day an artist ambulated into Kerosenelampville,
and Silas asked him:</p>

<p class='c005'>“How much’ll you charge to paint my
house with me a-standin’ in the door?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The artist said fifty dollars, and Silas told
him to go ahead with the work.</p>

<p class='c005'>In due course the painting was finished.
But, alas! the careless artist clean forgot
to paint my cousin on the picture.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I like it,” said Silas; “but where’s me,
lad—where’s me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The error he had made flashed across the
artist, but he tried to pass it off with a joke.
“O,” he said, “you’ve gone inside to get
my fifty dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, have I?” said Silas; “p’r’aps I’ll be
coomin’ out soon, and if I dew I’ll pay you;
in t’ meantime we’ll hang it up and wait.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Just as I had entered a barber’s shop to-day
and was hanging my top-piece on a nail, a
290-pounder rushed in and said to the only
other man in the place—a fellow with his
coat and vest off and an apron tied around
his waist:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want my hair cut, and no talk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The——” began the man in the apron.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No talk, I tell you!” shouted the heavy
man. “Just a plain hair-cut. I’ve read all
the papers and don’t want any news. Start
away now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The man in the apron obeyed.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he had finished, the man who knew
everything rose from his chair and surveyed
himself in the glass.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Great Scott!” he exclaimed. “It’s really
true, then? You barbers can’t do your work
properly unless you talk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know,” said the man in the apron,
quietly. “You must ask the barber. He’ll
be in presently. I’m the glazier from next
door.”</p>

first you always put the left one on last.</p>

<p class='c005'>What kind of cow gives the milk of human
kindness?</p>

an awful time married women would have
trying to find their husbands!</p>

<p class='c005'>If the man who wrote “The Snow, the
Snow, the Beautiful Snow” lived in Florida,
then the man who wrote “There Is No Place
Like Home” never had a wife; ergo, no
mother-in-law!</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is more pleasure in giving than in
receiving.” Certainly, if you are talking
about a licking. Any five-year-old kid knows that.</p>

<p class='c005'>Most people keep their spirits up by pouring
spirits down.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Society for the Prevention of Crime is
going to stop the Poultry Show in Madison
Square, New York. They say it is a fowl
(foul) show.</p>

<p class='c005'>A bald-headed man is surer of salvation

there being not a hair between him
and Heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>You can use the old saying “Slow but

<p class='c004'>Tom (Comedian): Can you tell me where
there’s a fire-insurance office?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick (Straight): Why, are you going to
insure your property?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Well, not exactly; but my boss
says he’s going to fire me, and I want to see
if I can’t get protection from the fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, why don’t you attend to business?
Get around bright and early in the
morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I would, only my watch stopped
this morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: What was the matter with it?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: A bedbug got between the ticks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, quit your kidding! I want to ask
you something serious—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I don’t get paid until Saturday.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, I don’t want money. I have a
plenty of that.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: My goodness! How long since?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: I want you to understand that I am
very well off.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Tom: Yes; you’re away off. (Taps forehead.)</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: But I knew the time when a bean
sandwich looked like a week’s board to you.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, you needn’t tell everybody
here about it—that’s my misfortune.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I won’t say a word. But if you
don’t behave I’ll tell everybody here that I
loaned you a shirt, till you get yours from
the laundry—</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Say, please keep—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: O, I won’t breathe it, don’t worry;
and I won’t say a word about you wearing
my collar and tie, either—</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick (angrily): See here—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: O, shavings! Don’t get angry!</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, then, listen and be serious. I
have written a play—</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick (sarcastically): I suppose you think
you could write one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I did write one; I wrote a melodrama.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: A melodrama, eh? Was anybody
killed?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Tom: No; the audience yelled for the author,

didn’t. Now in my first act—</p>

about my coal-bin?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: No; is it a good one?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Say, a fellow asked me to-day if he
would have to take a course in a barber-school
before he could shave ice at a soda-water
counter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave! In the first act I have
introduced a—</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Yes; a piece of cheese—no; nothing
of the sort. The idea!</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: I suppose there are several ways.
What is the best way to catch a rat?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Crawl in a pantry and smell like a
piece of cheese.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Will you behave? I heard you had
been speculating on the board of trade?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Yes; I was a speculator.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Dick: What were you, a bull or a bear?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Neither. They made a monkey out
of me.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Serves you right! In the first act—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Say, are you still in the first act?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Certainly. Why don’t you let me
go on?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: O, go on; I don’t care what happens.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, in the first act, I have written—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: You have written home for money.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Yes, I have written home—no,
nothing of the sort.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Not guilty?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Not guilty; my folks haven’t seen
my face in four months.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: My goodness! Why don’t you
wash it?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Now, stop it, I tell you! In the first
act—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Why is a cascaret?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Why is a cascaret what?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Because it works while you sleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: For goodness sake! is that a joke?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Tom: I should say so. It’s one of the best
I ever traveled with.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Then you don’t travel with much,
do you?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: No; I generally travel with you.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave, you rascal!</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Say, do you know what?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: No; what?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: What is worse than a giraffe with a
sore throat?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Why, I can’t imagine anything
worse. What is worse?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: A centipede with the chilblains.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: I wish you’d behave! I was going by
your house yesterday, and I saw your sister
looking out of the window; but I didn’t see
any of the rest of the family—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Well, sister is the only one that’s
working, and she looks out for us all.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Behave! Behave! Is your sister a
blonde?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: No, but she’s dyeing to be one.
(Slaps himself on the wrist.) Behave! how
dare you!</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Say, are you going to listen to me?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Certainly.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Dick: Well, in the first act the villain
comes on and strikes the heroine—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: For ten cents to buy an automobile.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Yes, for ten cents to buy an auto—no,
no, he strikes her—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Why, he must belong to the union,
then?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Certainly, he does—no, he doesn’t
either. The idea!</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: If two peaches make a date, and two
dates make a pair, what do apples make?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Why, apples make cider, of course.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: And Pears make soap, is it?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Is it! You talk like a cake of yeast.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Sure. You see I always rise when I
talk. Ha, Ha!</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: What are you laughing at?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: That joke. I thought of it so quick.
It must be quick-rising yeast, are they?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Are they! There you go again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Did you hear about it?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Hush! Can you keep a secret?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Sure.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I’m married.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Why, that’s news to me. How long
have you been married?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Six months.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Six months, eh? And I suppose you
think your wife is an angel?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: No, not quite—but I have hopes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave! You know in the first
act—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: You know when I asked my wife’s
father to marry his daughter, I said: “I love
your daughter and I can’t live without her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Very noble of you. And what did
the old gentleman say?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: He says: “Take her, young man; I
can’t live with her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Ha, ha! And you took her?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I did. I took her for better or worse,
and got the worst of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Too bad! But who gave the bride
away?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Her little brother.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Dick: Her little brother? I never heard of
such a thing. The father usually gives the
bride away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: The old man never said a word. It
was her little angel-faced brother. He told
everybody that she had a cork leg. It was
an awful case of give away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Then I suppose you took a bridal
tour?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: No; I felt more like taking an ax to
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Why, that, wouldn’t be very nice—to
take an ax to her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I would, only she began to sing “O,
Woodman, Spare that Tree.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave!</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: You know my wife used to be a
“summer girl.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: And what is a “summer girl?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: A “summer girl” is a rack to
stretch shirt-waists on; inside is a compartment
for lobster salad, chop suey and ice
cream; while outside is an attachment for
diamond rings.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: A very good definition, my boy. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>suppose you hung a diamond ring on the outside?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: No; I hung up my watch on the inside
of a pawnshop.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, don’t worry—a man should
be satisfied with what he has.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: O, I’m satisfied with what I have.
It’s what I haven’t got that causes most of
my dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: You look well. That ought to help
some.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I just returned from taking a water
cure.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Did you derive any benefit from the
water?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I don’t know. You see the water
was in a well, and I think the exercise I got
going to the well helped me.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Why, was the well a long way off?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Yes; you see I was far from well.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave! In the first act—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Is your play funny?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Yes; every hearty laugh adds a day
to a person’s life, you know.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I don’t believe it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Why not?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Tom: I laughed yesterday when a guy
slipped on a banana peel, and I’ll bet he
kicked ten days off of my life, all right.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, you only got what was coming
to you. Now the first act—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Here’s a funny thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: What’s that?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Why, night falls but it doesn’t
break.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, what, of it?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: O, nothing, except that day breaks
but it doesn’t fall.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave!</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: My landlady forgot this morning
and helped me to a second piece of steak.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: That was luck.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Yes, tough luck.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave! I see that Kid McCoy
says he’s willing to meet any man in the
world for any amount of money.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: So am I.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: So are you? Why, the idea! Ha, ha!
That makes me laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Laugh away; but I’ll meet any
man in the world for any amount of money,
any old time.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Dick: You will?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Yes, I will. J. P. Morgan preferred.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Good! You’re all right. Well, in
the first act the heroine is discovered asleep
in a snow-bank.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Then she must have cold feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Yes, she has cold—no, she hasn’t
got cold feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: O, she has a hot-water bag on her
feet?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Yes, she has, of course—no, she
hasn’t either. The heroine is discovered asleep
in a snow-bank and the villain comes on
and—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: And she wakes up and gives him the
“frozen face.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Yes, now you’ve got it—O, behave!</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Say, my old maid sister found a man
under her bed last night.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Is that so? What did she do, send
for a policeman?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: No; she sent for a minister.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave!</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I ain’t going to church any more.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Dick: Not going to church? Why, what’s
the reason?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I’m sore at the minister.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: What about?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: When my brother died the minister
said he had gone to join the great majority.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, what’s wrong with that?
That’s simply an expression: “Gone to join
the great majority.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Yes, but two weeks ago he said
that more people went down below than
there were up above. Wouldn’t that jingle
your small change?</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: I understand your brother was a
hard drinker?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Yes; his habits were a little moist.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Moist?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Yes, he kept pretty well soaked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: The idea! In the first—</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Gee! but my father was late in getting
home last night.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: What made him late?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: The trolley-car kept stopping every
two minutes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Every two minutes?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: Yes, it would stop every two minutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and then wait one minute before starting
again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Wasn’t your father angry at the
waits?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: No, they were only short waits and
he’s used to short weights—he’s in the coal
business.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave!</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: If you ever do what you did last
night I’ll never speak to you again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: What did I do?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: I met you last night just as I was
coming in the hotel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Yes; what of it?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: You were going out of the hotel
when I was coming in, and you insulted me.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Insulted you? How did I insult you?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: You were singing a song.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: Well, what of it? There’s no harm
in that. What song was I singing?</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom: “All Going Out; Nothin’ comin’
in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick: O, behave!</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>“A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Bishop Conaty, rector of the Catholic University
at Washington, while on a visit to
Brooklyn recently, told of a priest’s experience
in a small New England town. The clergyman
was just about to retire for the
night when he heard a knock at his door.
He called “Come in,” and a negro presented
himself and said, rather shamefacedly:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Father, there is a girl outside. May I bring
her in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Assent having been given, he disappeared
for a moment, and returned with a white
woman and informed the scandalized priest
that they wished to be married.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was shown the door with promptness,
and the girl was severely admonished on the
course she was pursuing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fifteen minutes later there came another
knock, and on opening the door the priest
found himself again face to face with the
would-be colored bridegroom.</p>

<p class='c005'>With great indignation the priest said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought I sent you about your business
before!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The darkey paralyzed him with this reply:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I know you did, Father James; but
Mary and I have talked it over, and we
thought maybe you would look at the matter
differently if you knew I was willing to
turn Irish.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>AN ORIGINAL HABEAS CORPUS CASE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Some years ago a well-known promoter
started to boom a new town in Montana. He
adopted the usual methods, built electric railroads,
established an electric-light plant, put
up business blocks, and erected himself a fine
house.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the other business enterprises he
established a bank, of which he made himself
president, and, in order to inspire confidence
in this, as well as in his other ventures, he
persuaded some well-known Montana men to
become directors, among others the then
United States Senator T. C. Power.</p>

<p class='c005'>Things went along swimmingly until the
panic of 1893, and then the bubble burst,
and the bank suffered in consequence. At a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>directors’ meeting, at which the president
was conspicuous by his absence, it was decided
that rather than have the bank fail,
each stockholder would “dig up” and save it.
After the meeting the members of the board
went around to Mr. Promoter’s house to acquaint
him with their decision. They found
him smoking in his luxurious library, and he
listened attentively until the spokesman had
finished his explanation, and then he said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is a very good idea, gentlemen,
very, and I only regret I cannot join you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not?” inquired almost every man
at once.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because I have absolutely nothing to
give.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s the matter with your business
blocks?” asked one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They belong to my wife,” suavely replied
Mr. Promoter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How about your electric railroad?” inquired
another.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That, too, belongs to my wife.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, to whom does this house belong?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I gave it to my wife as soon as it was
built. I am very sorry, but you see I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>absolutely nothing but my body that I can
call my own. I would gladly give that to be
divided up if it would do any good.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, gentlemen,” and Senator Power
spoke for the first time, “if you decide to
accept Mr. Promoter’s last proposition and
take his body, I speak for his gall.”</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>LI HUNG CHANG’S JOKE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A salutation of respect in China is to comment
on the mature and even venerable appearance
of one’s guest. When the Minister
to Siam called officially on Li Hung Chang
he was accompanied by a prominent missionary,
a man eighty years of age, with
white hair and beard, who was to serve as interpreter.
Unknown to Mr. Barrett, the missionary
and the Chinaman had had a falling
out some years before. Li came into the reception-room,
saluted Mr. Barrett cordially,
and bowed stiffly to the patriarchal interpreter.
To the youthful minister the premier said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“I congratulate you, sir, on your venerable
mien.” And then, nodding toward the
octogenarian, he asked: “And is this your
son?”</p>

I have written the scenario of a
play, which I think will prove
an innovation in the drama. It
is entitled plain “MICKEY THE
MOUSE: or, THE POROUS
PLASTER.” The porous plaster does not
appear in the play at all—I merely tack it
on the title to make the play draw well.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ACT I</h3>

<p class='c016'>Scene 1: Curtain rises to terrific snow-storm.
Thermometer 906 degrees below
faro—zero. Heroine, as poor flower-girl,
enters in an automobile; bunch of violets in
each hand, bunch of roses in another, while
with the other she holds herself—erect.
She wears a beautiful sealskin coat, and a sad
smile, for her parents have only five million
dollars apiece and no coal, and she has to help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>support the family by selling violets and daffodils
at so much per daffi.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fresh violets! Fresh roasted violets!”
she cries. Enter chorus and sing song in answer
to The Maiden’s Prayer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Exit chorus, enter villain, an icy smile on
his face. Can you blame it?</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have come to ask you for your hand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have only two. I have none to spare—I
need them both!” the maiden cries.</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, car-r-ses! car-r-ses! and once again
car-r-ses! Can nothing thaw you?” the villain
thus speaks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are a bum actor. I cannot give you
a hand. I can only give you the frozen face.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Filed—foiled! in act first, but watch
my smoke in act two.” Curtain, VERY
quick curtain.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ACT II</h3>

<p class='c016'>Scene 2: Same as in Act I, only more so.</p>

<p class='c005'>The snow is still snowing. Nothing is heard
but the howling of the audience—howling
of the wind. Enter the villain and Mickey the
Mouse. Villain bribes The Mouse to kidnap
the heroine, tie her to the cold, cold snow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>go down to the river, bring it back, and
make the heroine take a cold plunge—to
death.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mickey the Mouse accepts. Enter Chasem
Cheese, the brave detective. He has been on
the trail of the mouse so long that he has
grown stale.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Mouse smells Mr. Cheese. Exit The
Mouse. Cheese follows closely, still strong
on the scent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Heroine enters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hot roses! Red-hot roses! Please buy
my roses!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Enter The Mouse. Womanlike, she screams
at sight of The Mouse. He seizes her and is
just about to splash her into the river, which
the property-man has just pushed on. She
begs him not to throw her into the cold, cold
water, but to wait until it’s warmer. “You
had a mother once,” she cries.</p>

<p class='c005'>He did happen to have a mother once, and
he relents; he waits until the ice thaws, then
he throws her in.</p>

<p class='c005'>She is about to swallow the river, when
the hero comes on and does a song and
dance. One more swallow and the river
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>would vanish forever, but the hero does not
wait. He plunges in and gets his feet wet—all
for the love of her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shaved—saved!” she cries; “you have
saved my golden hair from being lost forever!”</p>

<p class='c005'>O, joy! exceeding joy! Exit sorrow until
act third.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ACT III</h3>

<p class='c016'>Scene 1: Home of the poor flower-girl, on
Fifth Avenue, New York.</p>

<p class='c005'>Heroine discovered in boudoir of her
wretched million-dollar residence. Enter
French maid with card.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tis he!” the heroine screams—“my
brave hair-restorer!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She glides down the marble staircase; she
would have done a two-step, but the glide is
more fashionable.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is no handle on the front door, so
she opens it with a glad smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hero walks in upon her invitation; she
seats herself upon his entering, and, with a
scream, faints upon his departure.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again quick curtain.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>ACT IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Scene 1: Same as Act III.</p>

<p class='c005'>Heroine discovered in a pensive mood and
an expensive gown.</p>

<p class='c005'>Enter villain without knocking. He is no
“knocker,” though he be a villain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have come for me answer!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you have it wrapped up?” she answers,
a la Siegel-Cooper, and, seizing a glass
of wine, she dashes it in the villain’s face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Car-r-se the luck!” he yells. “The drinks
are on me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Slow curtain to give the villain time to put
on dry clothes for Act V.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c005'>Now, instead of an elapse of nine years
between acts four and five, I have written
the play in nine acts. That ought to prove
an innovation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Between acts seven and eight another innovation:
coffee and rolls will be served. The
ushers will pass hot coffee and the curtain
will come down with a roll.</p>

<p class='c005'>Between acts eight and nine morning papers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>will be distributed, and the milkmen will
be admitted free.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now comes Act V.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<h3 class='c015'>ACT V</h3>

<p class='c016'>Scene: Home of The Mouse.</p>

<p class='c005'>He is discovered trying to get into the ice-box
for something to eat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Enter Chasem Cheese, the brave detective.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Mouse is surprised at the entrance of
Cheese.</p>

<p class='c005'>Desperate struggle.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Mouse seizes a keg of gunpowder, hurls
it at Cheese and blows him into a thousand
pieces.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Cheese will not give up.</p>

<p class='c005'>Startling and thrilling climax:</p>

<p class='c005'>A piece of Cheese chases The Mouse off the
stage to quick music.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c005'>That’s as far as I can get. That finish to
Act V is so strong I don’t know what to
do for the other four acts.</p>

<p class='c005'>A piece of cheese chasing a mouse has got
anything beat that I ever heard of in a drama.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this epoch making book in which truth makes the wildest
imaginings of the wizards of fiction dull and commonplace, Sophie
Lyons, known to the police of two continents as the shrewdest,
cleverest, brainiest, and most daring and resourceful criminal of
the age, tears aside the veil and reveals the most desperate characters
of the underworld, the millionaire aristocrats of crime, as they
plot, plan and later execute their dark and incredible deeds. With
breathless interest we watch these masked midnight marauders as
the mighty steel vaults of the greatest financial institutions swing
wide at their bidding, yielding their boundless treasures to the
crafty cracksman and scientific burglar, the magic manipulators
of gun, dynamite and jimmy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Florence Warden is the Anna Katharine Greene of England.
She apparently has the same marvelous capacity as Mrs. Rohlfs
for concocting the most complicated plots and most mystifying
mysteries, and serving them up hot to her readers.”—<i>N. Y. Globe.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>“The author has a knack of intricate plot-work which will
keep an intelligent reader at <i>her</i> books, when he would become
tired over far better novels not so strongly peppered. For even
the ‘wisest men’ now and then relish not only a little nonsense,
but as well do they enjoy a thrilling story of mystery.
And this is one—a dark, deep, awesome, compelling if not convincing
tale.”—<i>Sacramento Bee.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>“The interest of the story is deep and intense, and many
guesses might be made of the outcome, as one reads along, without
hitting on the right one.”—<i>Salt Lake Tribune.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>This book contains 310 pages, printed in large clear
type, and is bound in handsome paper cover. It is

<p class='c005'>Here is another rattling good
book that we unhesitatingly recommend

a thrilling detective story. Each

moonshiners in Southern Georgia,
whose business was that of
manufacturing illicit whisky.</p>

Riders,” and his daring escape from them at their
meeting in the Valley of Death, forms one of the
many exciting incidents of the story.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of our readers writes to us as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was absolutely unable to stop reading “Macon
Moore” until I had finished it. I expected to read
for an hour or so, but the situations were so dramatic
and exciting at the end of each chapter, that before I
knew it I had started the next one. I have read it
three times, once while practicing exercises on the
piano, and shall read it again. It is a corker.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A book of this sort would necessarily
be anonymous, and the name of the author
is not essential as indicative of literary
ability, the strength of the story depending
upon its action as revealed through
the laying bare of the innermost secrets of
a “Princess of the Realm” whose disposition
and character were such as to
compel her to find elsewhere than in her
own home the love, tenderness, admiration,
and society which was lacking there,
and which her being craved. Position, money and power,
seem to those who do not possess them, to bring happiness.
Such is not the case, however, where stability of character is
lacking and where one depends upon the pleasures of sense
for the enjoyment of life rather than on the accomplishment of
things worth while, based on high ideals.</p>

<p class='c005'>The writer has taken a page from her life and has given it
to the world. She has laid bare the soul of a woman, that
some other woman (or some man) might profit thereby. The
names have been changed, and such events omitted as might
lead too readily to the discovery of their identity. Each the
victim of circumstance, yet the <i>price</i> is demanded of the one
who fell the victim of environment.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>The Confessions of a Princess</i> is the story of a woman

boil so gently that the water will remain about as warm as a June day.
By so doing the fish can swim about in the kettle, and come to the table,
along with the other guests, in a not overheated condition. It will require
about eight minutes to cook a fish weighing one pound, and of course, only
four minutes to cook one weighing twice as much.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>To Fry Fish.</span>—Remove the works from the interior department, pick
off the scales, remove the teeth, and fry in a frying pan—or anything else
which fancy dictates.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Chicken Croquettes.</span>—Having stunned a heavy set hen, croquet the
dark meat through three wickets. Loose croquet the bust and other blonde
meat until you are a rover. Chop it all up and add something to make it
stick together, mould it into sausages, roll in bass-wood sawdust (the croquettes,
not yourself). Fry in red-hot lard.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Calves-Foot Jelly.</span>—Get a yard of the material, i. e., three feet.
Chicago beef is best, as the calves have the largest feet. Cut off the calf for
future reference. Wash the feet, applying chilblain remedies when necessary,
boil them for a while or so, add enough glue to thicken; stir in a few
molasses, strain through a cane-seated chair. Pour the amalgamation
into a blue bowl with red pictures on it, and send the whole business to a
sick friend.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Angel Cake.</span>—Chop up green apples, raisins, bananas, in quantities
to suit; stick them in dough. Feed to the children and the angel part will
materialize.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Roman Punch.</span>—Only a Roman nose how to prepare this dish properly.
To prepare it the other way add some rum to your punch. This
should be served before the roasts at dinner, but should be eaten frugally,
as it was a Roman punch that killed Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Emergencies.</span>—Should a child swallow a button, lower a button-hole
down its throat with a piece of string, pass it over the button and yank it
out.——If you see a runaway horse approaching and are unable to get out
of his way, speak to him firmly, saying, “Lie down, sir!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>To Tell A Bad Egg.</span>—This depends entirely on what you wish to tell
the egg. If it be bad news, break it gently—this applies both to the communication
and the fruit. The former had better be made by telephone,
with the safety plug in position.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>To Break a Colt.</span>—Hit him across the back with a sledge hammer.
One blow should be sufficient to break him—or at least break his back.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>To Make Ice-Water Last.</span>—Prepare everything else first.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>How to Read Character by Handwriting.</b>
By Henry Rice. Even to the uninitiated eye there is a greater or less
degree of difference in every handwriting, such as the slope of the letters,
the upward or downward slant of the line, the coarseness or delicacy
of the writing, its neatness and legibility. What the uninitiated do
not know is that each of these peculiarities is indicative of the character
of the writer, yet a student will be surprised to see the revelations
which a few moments’ intelligent perusal of a specimen of handwriting
will afford him. Over sixty specimens of handwriting and letters are
given in this book, with comments by Mr. Rice as to the different characteristics
from a scientific standpoint. Graphology opens up a new
field for intelligent effort, and the rapid strides it has been making the
past few years bid fair to soon place it above Palmistry, Astrology, etc.,
in point of popularity. Book sent postpaid for 25 cents.</p>

<p class='c004'><b>Pursuit of Virtue.</b> By Roland Burke Hennessy, author

<p class='c004'><b>Fortune-Telling by Cards.</b> Here, indeed, is a book
every young man or woman should have. To-day “playing cards” for
an evening’s enjoyment is a most popular pastime. No matter where
you are, no matter where you go, nowadays “playing cards” is the
thing. When played solely for amusement it is a most innocent entertainment,
and at the same time a great memory-trainer. You must have
often noticed at card parties, while sitting or standing around waiting
for late arrivals to come, there are a few moments when you wish
they’d start, or you wish there was “something doing.” Just at this
moment is your chance to make a hit with your fortune-telling by
cards. No matter how “bum” you are at it, the girls will flock around
you four and five deep. You will be the king bee, as it were, and you
will have the inward pleasure of making the other boys feel like a long
skirt on a rainy day—very damp. In addition to the above, “Fortune-Telling
by the Magic Crystal” is gone into in detail, giving all the symbols
for a correct divination of the future. “The Oraculum: or, Napoleon
Buonaparte’s Book of Fate” (specially translated) is given here
for perhaps the first time in the English language. A table of questions
generally applicable has been compiled, and sixteen pages of answers,
to suit any temperament or individuality, are given. “Fortune-Telling
with Dice” is very complete, giving an assorted list of thirty-two answers
to questions for every possible throw of two dice. Get this book,
study it, and spring it on the “bunch” at the first opportunity, and if
the girls don’t say you are certainly IT we’ll refund the money. There’s
many a time you’d pay $10 to make a hit with ONE girl—here’s a
chance to make a hit with any number of them—all for 25 cents.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, indeed, is a book every
young man or woman should have.
You must have often noticed at
card parties, while sitting or standing
around waiting for late arrivals
to come, there are a few moments
when you wish they’d start, or you wish there
was “something doing.” Just at this moment is
your chance to make a hit with your fortune-telling
by cards. No matter how poor you are at it, the
crowd will flock around you four and five deep. You
will be the king bee, as it were, and you will have
the inward pleasure of making the others feel
like a long skirt on a rainy day—very damp. In
addition to the above, “Fortune-Telling by the Magic
Crystal” is gone into in detail, giving all the symbols
for a correct divination of the future. “The Oraculum:
or, Napoleon Buonaparte’s Book of Fate” (especially
translated) is given here for perhaps the first
time in the English language. A table of questions
generally applicable has been compiled, and 16 pages
of answers, to suit any temperament or individuality,
are given. “Fortune-Telling With Dice” is very complete,
giving an assorted list of 32 answers to questions
for every possible throw of two dice. Get this
book, study it, and use it at the first opportunity,
and if the girls don’t say you are certainly IT we’ll
refund the money. Here’s a chance to make a hit.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sweetest American story
ever written,” wrote one critic in
reviewing the story, which first
appeared as a serial in a magazine
of large circulation. A
strong inquiry for the novel in
book form developed, and we
have just issued the book to meet this demand.</p>

<p class='c005'>The story is wholly American in sentiment, and
every chapter appeals to the reader’s sympathies, as
the whole book pulsates with pure and cherished
ideals. The love theme is sweet and intensely interesting.
Through the political fight, the victory and
the defeat, the love thread is never lost sight of. The
intense struggle in the heart of the heroine between
her Church and her lover is of such deep human interest,
that it holds the reader in ardent sympathy until
the happy solution, when the reader smiles, wipes the
moisture from the eyes, and breathes happily again.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the narrative is intensely interesting, it is
more; it instructs and educates. To read it is to feel
improved and delighted. Don’t miss this treat; it is
one of the very best American stories of recent years.</p>

<p class='c005'>The book is printed on best quality of laid book
paper, contains nearly 200 pages, and is bound in
paper covers with handsome illustration. It will be

class of readers—people
who have lived long enough to
realize that there are huge problems
of sex and matrimony, that
can only be solved through the
actual experience of the persons
concerned. Numberless
books have been and are being
written and published treating
on these questions, and if
through reading them we are
enabled to enlarge our view,
look at our problem from a
different angle, appropriate for our own use the
benefit of others’ experience either actual or imaginary,
by just so much are we better able to live and
think aright and secure to ourselves the happiness
that is our inherent right and goal.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>It Tells</b> how to make the Eggs of Pharo’s Serpents, from which, when
lighted, though but the size of a pea, there issues from it a coiling, hissing
serpent, wonderful in length and similarity to a genuine serpent.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>It Tells</b> of a simple and ingenious method for copying any kind of drawing
or picture. And more wonderful still, how to print pictures from
the print itself.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>It Tells</b> how to perform the Davenport Brothers’ “Spirit Mysteries,” so
that any person can astonish an audience, as has been done. Also
scores of other wonderful things which we have no room to mention.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>OLD SECRETS AND NEW DISCOVERIES</b> contains over 250 solid pages
of reading matter, and is worth $1.50 to any person; but it will be mailed
to any address on receipt of only 25 cents. Postage stamps taken in payment

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
